# Technical Appendix — Master Symbol Registry & Notation Audit (2026-06-07)

**Status: SYNCED to merged TA (`origin/main` fd12275) 2026-06-09.** Built from a 7-agent exhaustive catalog of every symbol in `TechnicalAppendix_v2.0.0.html` (lines 1–8041), consolidated + collision-swept + standard-notation-checked. Internal source-of-truth; the reader-facing Notation section (`manuscript/back-matter/symbol-registry.html`) is curated FROM this.

> **SYNC BANNER (2026-06-09, refactor-bib-consolidation session).** Every Batch I + Batch II rename and the closeout notation changes are now **verified APPLIED in the merged TA** (grep-confirmed, HTML-entity forms): δ-decay→**κ** (`&kappa;`×2, defined on first use L7299); §16.3 region E→**Ω** (`&Omega;`×6, L7320 w/ collision note); §16.2 innovation α→**ζ**, β→**ω** (`&zeta;`/`&omega;`×4, L7308, noted distinct from M3 α); σ→**ς** (`&sigmaf;`, 0 literal-σ stragglers); **log→ln** (0 residual `log(`); **V_option→V_market** (28/0); **τ overload RESOLVED** (`S(τ|t₀)`=0; substitutability written `S(t | t₀)`); **β fully removed** (0); **§10 A1–A4/P1–P4 relabeled to roman (i)–(iv) + (a)–(d)** (0 old labels; 12 `Assumption (i…)`), so the A/P collision is resolved by RENAME, not note. Remaining genuinely-open items routed to WS3 standard-notation pass: E externality-fn vs E[·] expectation; bare B vs "billion" suffix; M vs "million"; Theorem 10.3 (i)–(iv) used for both clauses + assumptions. The 2 residual `&delta;` (L3522) are the standard ε–δ analysis variable — correct, not a stray decay-δ.

**Method:** 7 parallel catalog agents (one per line-range), each recording every symbol-occurrence (glyph · meaning · role · section · line · units · provenance) + within-range collisions + existing disambiguation notes. This file consolidates to distinct (symbol × meaning) pairs and flags cross-section collisions.

**Legend:** Role D=definition site, u=use. Collision severity: 🔴 HIGH (same glyph, genuinely different quantity, reader-confusing) · 🟠 MED (case/subscript-distinguished or one-section-local) · 🟢 OK (already disambiguated in text, or standard).

## PART 1 — COLLISIONS REQUIRING ACTION (the headline)

### 🔴 HIGH — same glyph, genuinely different quantity, NOT disambiguated

| Glyph | Meaning A | Meaning B | Locations | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **α** | Method-3 **irreversibility probability** ∈[0,1] (§3.5, §11.5–11.8) | §16.2 **scarcity effect on innovation incentives** (coefficient >0) | A: 893–4, 4295ff, 5063ff · B: 7305ff | ✅ **RESOLVED** — §16.2 innovation-α renamed → **ζ** (`&zeta;`, noted distinct from M3 α at L7308). M3 α kept. |
| **β** | Method-3 **risk-posture exponent** in 1/(1−α)^β (§3.5, §11.8) | §16.2 **scarcity-elasticity exponent** on (Q_crit/Q) (innovation) | A: — · B: 7305ff | ✅ **RESOLVED** — M3-β DROPPED (Path A; no free exponent); §16.2-β renamed → **ω** (`&omega;`). bare β = 0 in merged TA. |
| **δ** | §16.1 **discount-rate decay constant** in r(t)=r₀·e^(−δt)+r_min | §10.3 proof **ε–δ neighborhood width** (standard analysis variable) | A: → κ (7296,7299) · B: 3522 | ✅ **RESOLVED** — decay δ renamed → **κ**, **defined on first use** (L7299). Only the standard ε–δ proof variable remains (L3522), which is correct. Path-B third-δ pre-empted. |
| **τ** | **scarcity threshold** τ_j (§1.8 line 485; §10.3, with a local "throughout this theorem" note) | ~~§5.4 future time in S(τ\|t₀)~~ (RESOLVED) | A: 485, 3488 | ✅ **RESOLVED** — the §5.4 future-time overload fixed to `S(t\|t₀)`; `S(τ\|t₀)` = 0 in merged TA. τ is now scarcity-threshold only. |
| **E** | **externality-tail function** E(R,t) (§1.4, §16.1, §17) | ~~§16.3 extraction region~~ → **Ω** (RESOLVED) | A: 404, 7338, 7659 · Ω: 7317,7320,7323 | ⚠️ **PARTIAL** — region E→**Ω** applied (`&Omega;`×6, L7320 note). **STILL OPEN (→WS3):** E(R,t) function vs standard expectation operator **E[·]** (reader-expectation collision). |
| **P** | **market price** P / P(t) (§1.3, §10.5, §14.1) | ~~§10 Premise labels P1–P4~~ (RESOLVED) | A: 371, 3692, 6542 | ✅ **RESOLVED** — §10 Premise labels relabeled to roman **(i)–(iv)** (and cost-function properties → **(a)–(d)**); P1–P4 = 0 in merged TA. P is market-price only. |
| **A** | **abundance** variable A(t) (§10.3, lines 3434–3552) | ~~§10 Assumption labels A1–A4~~ (RESOLVED) | A: 3434ff | ✅ **RESOLVED** — §10 Assumption labels relabeled to roman **(i)–(iv)**; A1–A4 = 0 in merged TA. Abundance A(t) and §1.8 commons-category Aⱼ remain (subscript-distinguished, benign). |
| **B** (bare) | **Accountability Bond** ($ quantity) | **"billion"** magnitude suffix in worked numbers ("55B BOE", "$942B") | A: 462, 6633 · B: 4241, 4533, 4605 | The billion-suffix B in §11 worked calcs sits next to the bond variable B. Sloppy in exactly the quantitative passages a referee reads closely. |

### 🟠 MED — case- or subscript-distinguished, or single-section-local (lower risk, worth a note)

| Glyph pair | A vs B | Locations |
|---|---|---|
| **r vs R** | discount rate r (§1.5, §14.1 Hotelling) vs resource R (argument) | 416, 6542 vs 327, 1459 |
| **s vs S** | integration dummy s in ∫r(s)ds vs substitutability S | 3585 vs 3577 |
| **m vs M** | externality growth exponent m vs divergence bound M (proof) | 3573 vs 3520 |
| **k vs K** | utility growth exponent k vs proof constant K | 3567 vs 3630 |
| **δ vs Δ** | ε–δ width δ vs change-operator Δ (ΔForeclosure_cost) | 3520 vs 3747 |
| **T vs t/t₀** | proof threshold time T vs time variable t | 3624 vs throughout |
| **c vs C vs 𝒞** | cost function c(A) vs cost component C/Cᵢ vs commons set 𝒞 (script) | 3440 vs 327 vs 327 |
| **V(x,t) vs V_option** | spatial value vs Method-3 option value | 7365 vs 889 |
| **C₁ vs B₁** | Foreclosure Cost C₁ (forward) vs Restitution Bond B₁ (backward) — subscript-1 carries *opposite* temporal valence | 1276 vs 1219 |
| **2%** | EPA SCC discount rate vs one of Weitzman's candidate rates | 5740 vs 6564 |
| **× (times)** | multiplication vs ratio-magnitude suffix ("33–122×") vs Cartesian product (ℝ×[t₀,∞)) | many |
| **→** | limit "approaches" vs function-domain map vs "yields" arrow | many |

### Units / undefined-notation issues (not collisions, same class of referee-risk)

- **log** — used in scarcity_multiplier `1+log(1+σ)×Hotelling_anchor`; worked value `log(101)≈4.6` is **natural log (ln 101≈4.615; log₁₀≈2.004)**, but **"log" is never defined as ln anywhere** in the document. (Lines 896, 4311, 4761, 5245.)
- **σ units** — defined as "commons-stock / sustainable-flow ratio" (line 892); a stock÷flow-rate ratio is **time-dimensioned**, yet σ is used as the dimensionless argument of `log(1+σ)`. Internal units inconsistency.

## PART 4 — STANDARD-NOTATION DEVIATIONS (VERIFIED 2026-06-07 against cited sources)

Verified by a standard-notation agent against Black–Scholes (Columbia/Haugh), Dixit–Pindyck (NBER w12486, MIT Pindyck lectures, Princeton UP), Hotelling. Confidence per row.

| Symbol | Standard meaning (source) | Framework use | Deviation | Risk | Decision |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **σ→ς** | **Volatility of the underlying** — universal in Black–Scholes & Dixit–Pindyck (HIGH conf.) | scarcity ratio | (was) direct conflict | (was) dismissal-grade | ✅ **DONE — σ→ς applied + stragglers cleaned.** Literal-σ = 0 in merged TA; ς present as `&sigmaf;`. |
| **δ** | **Convenience yield / payout rate** in Dixit–Pindyck (HIGH conf.) | §16.1 discount-rate decay constant | direct conflict (latent) | (was) MED→HIGH | ✅ **DONE — renamed → κ, defined on first use (L7299).** Path-B third-δ pre-empted. Only the standard ε–δ proof variable remains (L3522). |
| **β** | CAPM systematic risk + D–P fundamental-quadratic root (HIGH conf.) | (was) risk-posture exponent | — | — | ✅ **RESOLVED — DROPPED from M3 (Path A)**; no free exponent. |
| **α** | no dominant conflicting convention; ∈[0,1] reads naturally (MED–HIGH) | irreversibility probability (M3) | none (external) | LOW ext. / MED internal | **keep** M3 α; rename the §16.2 innovation-α instead. |
| **E** | **Expectation operator E[·]** (HIGH conf.) | externality fn E(R,t) + §16.3 extraction *region* | partial→direct | MED–HIGH | ✅ region → **Ω** DONE (`&Omega;`×6). ⚠️ **STILL OPEN → WS3:** externality fn E(R,t) vs expectation E[·] (consider fn → ℰ/X). |
| **r** | interest/discount rate — Hotelling (HIGH) | discount/interest rate | none | LOW | keep (preserve r-vs-R case discipline). |
| **Q, S** | Hotelling q=flow; Dasgupta–Heal S=stock (HIGH) | Q=stock; S=substitutability (deliberate redefinitions) | partial (intentional) | LOW | keep — disambiguation already present & adequate; reproduce in reader Notation section. |
| **log→ln** | `log(101)≈4.6` ⇒ natural log (HIGH — arithmetic) | unspecified-base log | ambiguity | LOW–MED | ✅ **DONE — ln applied throughout; 0 residual `log(` in merged TA** (`ln(`×5). |

**Verified bottom line (updated 2026-06-09 — all applied except the E-function residual):** σ→ς ✅ done (literal-σ=0); δ→κ ✅ done (defined L7299); β ✅ resolved (M3 drop + §16.2→ω); E-region→Ω ✅ done; log→ln ✅ done (0 residual). **The single remaining standard-notation item is the externality function E(R,t) vs the expectation operator E[·]** — routed to the WS3 standard-notation pass (propose→ratify→apply). α/r/Q/S remain defensible with their existing notes.

## PART 5 — REMEDIATION PLAN (proposed; ratify before applying)

Free Greek letters (unused anywhere in the TA, per the completeness sweep): γ ζ θ ι κ μ ν π φ χ ψ ω (capitals aside). Used: α β δ Δ ε η λ ξ ρ σ Σ τ.

### Batch I — M3-INDEPENDENT (✅ I-1/I-2/I-3 APPLIED + MERGED to `origin/main` fd12275 2026-06-09; I-6 SUPERSEDED by roman relabel; I-4 done; I-5 deferred→WS3)

| # | Collision | Fix | Locations |
|---|---|---|---|
| I-1 | §16.1 δ (decay) vs §10.3 ε–δ; undefined; pre-empts Path-B DP-δ | rename δ → **κ**; define "κ = decay constant" on first use | 7341, 7344 |
| I-2 | §16.3 E (extraction region) vs E(R,t) externality + E[·] | rename region E → **Ω** (and E∖K → Ω∖K) + note | 7362, 7365, 7368 |
| I-3 | §16.2 innovation α,β vs Method-3 α,β | rename §16.2 α→**ζ**, β→**ω** (keep Method-3 α,β) + note | 7350, 7353, 7356 |
| ~~I-4~~ | log base unspecified | ✅ **DONE via Path A (M3 session):** ln applied in §3.5; residual `log(` at TA 4314 pending M3 cleanup. | 896/904/4761/5245 ✓; 4314 pending |
| ~~I-5~~ | bare B vs "billion" suffix | **DEFERRED:** ~50 occurrences, all sourced numbers owned by the provenance session (§6/§11/§15); coordinate with that session rather than unilaterally edit its lines. NOT applied. | §6/§11/§15 |
| ~~I-6~~ | §10 A1–A4 (Assumptions) vs A(t) abundance; P1–P4 (Premises) vs P price | ✅ **SUPERSEDED — closeout went further than the proposed note:** labels RENAMED to roman (i)–(iv) (Assumptions/Premises) + (a)–(d) (cost-function properties). A1–A4/P1–P4 = 0; collision removed by rename, not note. | §10 |
| I-7 | registry completeness | add η_S (3455) ✓done; note integration dummies s (§10.3) / u (§16.1) | registry only |

### Batch II — M3-COUPLED — ✅ RESOLVED by Path A (2026-06-08, M3 session)

| # | Symbol | Resolution (Path A applied) |
|---|---|---|
| II-1 | **σ → ς** | ✅ applied in §3.5 (final sigma; reserves-to-production-grounded). Residual old-σ stragglers pending M3 cleanup: TA 4295, 4309, 4314, 4332, 4338, 6732. |
| II-2 | **β** | ✅ **DROPPED from M3** (not renamed to ψ) — irreversibility_premium = 1/(1−α), no free exponent (§3.5 line 901). M3-side β collision gone. |
| II-3 | **α** | ✅ kept; α-dominance narrative reframed to empirically-grounded + theorem-backed (§3.5 line 901) — substantially addresses correctness item #6 (verify the ~line 922 header still / no longer says "Sensitivity finding"). |

**Cross-branch merge dependency:** ✅ **RESOLVED.** The notation-sweep §16/§10 Batch I edits and the M3 §3.5 Path-A edits both landed in the TA closeout merged to `origin/main` fd12275 (2026-06-09). Both M3's α and §16.2's ζ-rename now coexist in one tree; the collision is gone (grep-verified).

### Sequencing
1. ✅ Batch I applied + merged (fd12275).
2. ✅ M3 Path-A resolved; Batch II applied + merged.
3. **▶ IN PROGRESS (this session):** reader-facing Notation section built from Part 2 → `manuscript/back-matter/symbol-registry.html`.
4. **▶ IN PROGRESS (this session):** Part 3 bib gaps (Brennan–Schwartz, Black–Scholes, Knight) folded into `research/literature/bibliography.md` (Step B).

**Note:** the verified σ finding is a *third* reason to resolve the M3 Path-A/B question — the direction determines whether σ must be renamed (Path A) or is vindicated as proper volatility (Path B).

---

## PART 6 — RESERVE POOL (unused letters + standard-notation baggage)

**Added 2026-06-08** (author request, during the M3 Path-A σ→ς decision). Purpose: a vetted pool of symbols to draw from as the book adds quantities, so future choices avoid both *internal* collisions (Part 1) and *reader-expectation* collisions.

**Governing principle (the σ=volatility lesson generalized):** "unused in this corpus" ≠ "free of meaning a reader brings." Before adopting any symbol, check it against (a) the used-symbol inventory (Part 2) for an internal collision, AND (b) the standard-notation baggage below for a reader-expectation collision. A symbol can be internally free yet still mislead — exactly the §3.5 σ problem (internally "scarcity," but every finance-literate reader reads volatility).

### Greek — unused in the corpus, with reader-expectation baggage flags

| Letter | Standard-notation baggage (reader expectation) | Use-cleanliness |
|---|---|---|
| **ι** (iota) | rarely used as a variable; "an iota" = a tiny amount | ✓ cleanest |
| **ζ** (zeta) | Riemann zeta function; damping ratio | ~ low |
| **ψ** (psi) | wavefunction; digamma function | ~ low (registry's suggested target for a retired M3 β) |
| **γ** (gamma) | Euler–Mascheroni constant; Lorentz factor; Γ gamma function; skewness | ⚠ moderate |
| **ν** (nu) | frequency; degrees of freedom; Poisson ratio | ⚠ moderate |
| **χ** (chi) | chi-squared; Euler characteristic | ⚠ moderate |
| **ω** (omega) | angular frequency; sample space; Omega ratio (finance) | ⚠ moderate |
| **φ** (phi) | golden ratio; **standard-normal density φ(·)**; potential; angle | ⚠ moderate–high |
| **θ** (theta) | angle; generic "the parameter"; **option Greek (time decay)** | ✗ avoid in option contexts |
| **π** (pi) | **the constant 3.14159 (universal)**; profit (econ); inflation (macro); Π product operator | ✗ avoid |
| **μ** (mu) | mean; micro- prefix; **drift in Black–Scholes / Dixit–Pindyck** | ✗ avoid (esp. option contexts) |
| **κ** (kappa) | curvature; option vega-adjacent | **TAKEN** — §16.1 decay constant (δ→κ, Batch I I-1) |

- **ς** (final sigma) — collision-free in the corpus (TA + chapters: 0 uses) and the recommended target for the §3.5 σ-scarcity rename (Part 4/5). Baggage: it *looks like* σ, so it only partially escapes the volatility-read — acceptable because its only association is sigma-adjacent (scarcity mnemonic), but **descriptive naming is the zero-baggage alternative.** Was omitted from the original used/free inventory (it's a sigma glyph-variant); record it here as RESERVED-for-M3-scarcity pending the Path-A apply.
- **Capitals** (Γ Θ Λ Ξ Π Φ Ψ Ω) are mostly free but inherit the same baggage as their lowercase forms (Π = product, Σ = sum [TAKEN], Ω = ohms/sample-space, Φ = normal CDF). Λ, Ξ unused-and-low-baggage if a capital is needed.

### Latin — guidance (not a full inventory)

Most single lowercase Latin letters are already in service as variables (Part 2: r, s, m, k, c, n, i, t, T, x, g, plus the framework set R, Q, S, P, E, B, C, D, U, A, V, K). Apparently-free and low-baggage: **f, h, j, w, y, z** (lowercase) and **G, H, J, L, M, N, W, X, Y, Z** (capitals) — **verify against Part 2 before use** (e.g., M is used as a proof bound and as a "million" suffix; E as expectation/region/externality). **Default for new quantities: a descriptive or subscripted name** (e.g., `S_RP`, `Cure_cost`) rather than a bare letter — descriptive names carry zero reader-expectation baggage, which is why they are the safe fallback whenever a clean single letter is unavailable.

> **Coordination note:** this Part 6 was appended from the `ta-m3-pathb` branch (the registry currently lives on `origin/main`). It is an end-append (low merge-conflict). Reconcile with the notation-sweep session's copy when branches merge; if that session has already advanced the registry, graft this section in.

## PART 7 — READER-FACING CANONICAL SYMBOL LIST (deduplicated; scan-verified complete)

**Added 2026-06-09 (back-matter consolidation).** Part 2 is the exhaustive per-section AUDIT
catalog (same glyph may recur across section tables). This Part 7 is the **deduplicated,
reader-facing canonical list** — each distinct quantity ONCE, grouped, with its canonical meaning.
The reader-facing `manuscript/back-matter/symbol-registry.html` is generated from THIS table
(`build.py gen-notation`). **Scan-verified complete:** `build.py scan-symbols` confirms the TA's
Greek set (Δ Σ Ω α δ ε ζ η κ λ ξ ρ ς τ ω — 15) is fully covered here with no gaps and no stale
entries; the Latin framework variables and compound/subscripted forms are included below.
